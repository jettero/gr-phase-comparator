gr-phase-comparator
===========

It irks me that there's no built in GRC block for comparing phases and
considering wrap-around.  Just how close is the phase exactly?  So here is a way
to do it.  It may not be very good, but it works.

===========

Requirements

GNU Radio 3.7
python 

*Installing GNU Radio*

maybe just run:
sudo apt-get install gnuradio

or maybe see this page:
http://gnuradio.org/redmine/projects/gnuradio/wiki/InstallingGR

*Installing the Phase Comparator*

buildname=gr-phase-comparator
buildloc=/tmp/$buildname

git clone http://github.com/jettero/$buildname.git
cd $buildname
src="$(pwd)"
mkdir $buildloc
cd $buildloc

* skip the -DMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX if you want /usr/local *
cmake -DCMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr "$src"
sudo make install

* maybe, instead, just use my build script*
PREFIX=/usr ./build.sh
